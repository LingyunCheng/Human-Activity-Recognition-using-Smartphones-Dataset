# Human-Activity-Recognition-using-Smartphones-Dataset
The requirement for the course 'Big Data Parallel Programming' is completing an individual project based on a big dataset in a cloud platform.
I will use Human Activity Recognition using Smartphones dataset avaliable in the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The database was built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. It has 10299 records and 561 attributes. 
My goal is building classifiers that can accurately identify the activities being performed by individuals using their smartphone sensor data.
Here is my planned steps for this project:
1. Load data in IBM Watson Studio
2. Explorate data: visualization.
3. Train 5 or more models to predict the human activity.(Logisticregression, SVM with various kernels, random forest, and decision tree.)
4. Compare the modelsâ€™ performance: accuracy.
5. The best model might has hyper-parameters, fine-tunning the parameters t ofind optimal solution.
6. This dataset has 561 attributes, dimension reduction might be a plus for the final performance of models. Two ways: feature extraction(e.g. LDA and PCA); feature selection.
